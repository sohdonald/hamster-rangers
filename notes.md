The evil sorceress, Whoopy Whoopy, has invaded Earth

It's up to the Hamster Rangers to thwart her ambitions and save the planet.

Hamster rangers can mix and match to summon different megazords

three teams
1. Coconut Avengers
2. Soggy Pillows
3. Tickle Elves

each team has five hamsters

by default, the teams have their own megazord they can summon

however, when 5 hamsters assemble from different teams, they summon 
either a special megazord or a lame sock puppet

Whoopi will call a random giant monster to invade Earth 

summon a megazord to defeat it
